## 2014/15 Season Analysis

### Similarity in Strength (Goals)

With an absolute threshold of 3 for goal difference, the network demonstrates **increased connectivity** (160 edges compared to 135 with a threshold of 2). This implies that a larger number of team pairs are now considered similar in their goal-scoring output.

The **centrality measures** show a notable shift, with teams like Leicester, West Ham, Everton, Hull, and Manchester United exhibiting higher degree centrality. This suggests these teams shared similar goal tallies with a broader spectrum of the league, indicating a potential **homogeneity in goal-scoring performance** across various league positions.

The **community detection** reveals several large, mixed groups:
* **Community 0** includes traditionally strong teams like Arsenal and Manchester United alongside teams like Leicester (who finished 14th). This indicates that the goal output of top teams in 2014/15 was within a $\pm$3 goal difference of many other clubs, suggesting that while their overall points tally differed, their raw goal counts were not as distinctly separated from the mid-table.
* **Community 2**, featuring Manchester City with teams like Aston Villa and Hull, further supports this. Despite significant differences in final league position, these teams shared similar absolute goal-scoring ranges.

### Similarity in Style (Aggressiveness)

Maintaining an absolute threshold of 5 for aggressiveness results in a network of 92 edges, consistent with your previous analysis. This highlights that this threshold defines a meaningful level of shared aggressiveness.

The **centrality measures** continue to emphasize teams like Sunderland, West Brom, and Aston Villa as central, suggesting that a particular band of aggressiveness was more prevalent among teams outside the traditional top tier.

**Community detection** offers intriguing insights into shared aggressive profiles:
* **Community 0** groups elite clubs like Arsenal, Manchester United, and Chelsea with teams from the lower half of the table. This indicates that, in 2014/15, these diverse teams exhibited remarkably **similar absolute levels of aggressiveness**, suggesting that tactical aggression might not always align directly with league standing or overall success.

### Similarity in Control (Possession)

Reducing the absolute threshold for control to 4 (from 5) significantly impacts the network, decreasing the number of edges to 38. This makes the network **highly fragmented**, as evidenced by the "not connected" warning and the emergence of multiple, smaller communities. This is a crucial finding: it strongly suggests that **possession styles in the Premier League are often quite distinct**, with differences frequently exceeding a narrow 4-unit margin.

The most striking observation from **community detection** is **Manchester City's isolation in Community 4**. This powerfully indicates that in 2014/14, Manchester City's ball possession was **uniquely high** and not within 4 percentage points of any other team's. This underscores their distinct, possession-dominant tactical identity.

## 2015/16 Season Analysis

### Similarity in Strength (Goals)

With an absolute threshold of 3 for goals, the network for 2015/16 shows a slight increase to 158 edges, indicating more widespread similarities in goal output compared to a threshold of 2.

**Centrality measures** highlight teams like Manchester United, Norwich, West Brom, Southampton, and Swansea as having similar goal totals to many other teams.

The **community structure** reinforces a key narrative of the season:
* **Community 0** is a large, diverse group that includes the champions **Leicester City**, alongside teams like Manchester City and Manchester United, and various mid-to-lower table clubs. This strongly supports the notion that Leicester's remarkable title win was not built on an overwhelmingly high goal tally that separated them from the rest of the league. Instead, their efficiency meant their absolute goal count was **similar to a broad spectrum of teams**, further emphasizing their unique and highly effective counter-attacking style.

### Similarity in Style (Aggressiveness)

The absolute threshold of 5 for aggressiveness yields a network of 85 edges, consistent with the previous season's findings.

**Centrality measures** once again identify Watford, Bournemouth, Arsenal, West Brom, and Sunderland as central.

**Community detection** provides insights into shared aggressive profiles:
* **Community 0**, a large cluster including **Leicester**, Bournemouth, Everton, Arsenal, and West Ham, indicates that Leicester's aggressive playing style in their championship season was **not an outlier** but rather fell within a range common to many other teams. This suggests a consistent level of aggression that contributed to their robust performance without being excessively high or unique.

### Similarity in Control (Possession)

Setting the absolute threshold for control at 4 leads to an even sparser network of 35 edges, further segmenting teams into smaller, more distinct communities. The "not connected" warning persists, underscoring the significant differences in possession philosophies across the league.

**Centrality measures** indicate West Ham, Everton, Norwich, and Watford as central within this fragmented network.

**Community detection** reveals highly specific groupings:
* **Community 4: Newcastle** is isolated, suggesting their possession statistics were highly unique in 2015/16 within this strict 4-unit similarity margin.
* **Community 1: Chelsea, Sunderland, Manchester City** is a particularly intriguing cluster. The grouping of possession-dominant sides like Manchester City and Chelsea with Sunderland suggests that these teams had surprisingly **similar absolute possession percentages** in 2015/16, possibly indicating a convergence in their midfield battle styles or a shared statistical profile despite different league positions.
* **Community 3** groups **Leicester** with Manchester United, Everton, Southampton, and Crystal Palace. This indicates that Leicester's control/possession style, while not necessarily dictating play, was statistically **similar to a specific group of teams** that year.
